This week at The Wheelhouse we are serving wok-grilled shrimp tacos. They come on our freshly made corn tortillas. 

These tacos are bursting with flavor and boast two sauces, the Arbol Garlic Sauce, which has tomatoes, Arbol chilis, apple cider vinegar, garlic, and coriander, AND the Sweet Pasilla Sauce, a smoked Pasilla pepper sauce sweetened with palm sugar and smelling of Mexican chilis. 

We are also serving a cabbage, avocado, lime & cilantro slaw on top of the shrimp tacos AND caramelized onion, cumin-lime, Mexican oregano black beans. Whew! Big description following huge flavors, all from scratch. Come by and try the special this week or next week at The Wheelhouse!
