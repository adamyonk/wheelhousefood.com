This week at The Wheelhouse we are serving up fish tacos to celebrate the warmer weather! These tacos start with homemade corn tortillas and hand battered fried white fish and are topped with a chipotle mayo slaw and fresh pico de gallo. It's served with a side of shredded green papaya salad infused with cumin, coriander and lime, sweetened with a little palm sugar.
