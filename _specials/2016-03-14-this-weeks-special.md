This week at The Wheelhouse we are serving a new special called Lad Na. 

Lad Na is a Thai/Lao-Chinese rice noodle dish that is reminiscent of French-Canadian poutine, chicken noodle soup, or a high quality Thanksgiving gravy. However, this distinctive dish, popular all over Thailand, has a signature Wheelhouse flare. With white pepper, New Mexico chilies, black soy sauce, fresh garlic, fermented yellow bean sauce, Chinese broccoli, white cabbage, julienned carrots, sliced mushrooms, and tons of careful attention to making the flavor perfect, this dish is very satisfying. Come eat it today or anytime this week, available vegan, vegetarian with egg added, with chicken, or with chicken and egg added. See you soon!
