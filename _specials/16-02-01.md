We are bringing back Biryani this week as our special!

Biryani, also called Pulao, is an old South Indian dish. It was a staple food
for armies in medieval India due to its adaptability to various ingredients
arising from change in location. Our Biryani has the aroma of cardamom pods
steamed with Turkish bay leaves and cinnamon sticks. The fresh jasmine rice
comes out brightly yellow with cashew nuts and dried fruit melded through it.
Full of umami flavor and surprising tastes moving together, this dish is so
nice. Fresh, homemade, soft paneer cheese with homemade clarified butter go
into the flaming hot wok with zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, onions, and the
steamed Biryani. Topped with crushed peanuts, cilantro, and a homemade
cilantro/cucumber chutney on the side. Nothing artificial, no shortcuts, made
from scratch! Order it vegetarian or add chicken!
