      The Wheelhouse will provide a breakfast menu available from 6 – 10:30 am
      that will consist of 3 hot dishes made fresh in the kitchen during
      breakfast hours and will also have pastries provided by B&B Boulangerie
      (Katie Kring), a local baker based in central Springfield. All pastries
      are made from scratch according to traditional european and world methods.
      Katie uses high quality flours, sugars and real butter in her pastries.
      She also bakes the ciabatta roll we have been using for the breakfast
      sandwiches.

      our sausage, bacon and pork butts.
