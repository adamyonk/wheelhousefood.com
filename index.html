    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>The Wheelhouse serves delicious fusion dishes. We use high quality ingredients, focusing on Thai and Mexican food and exploring other culinary traditions.</p>

    <p>Our menu is house crafted from quality produce, meat, and spices. We take the freshest, most flavorful ingredients and make food from scratch, resting upon tastes traditional to Thailand and Mexico while infusing tastes from other culinary traditions and the tradition of innovation.</p>

    <p>We grind and toast our spices instead of buying them pre-ground, we make all of our salsas/sauces, marinades, and side dishes using base ingredients instead of premade mixes, and we flatten and grill our taco tortillas.</p>

    <p>Our recipes are created by us through studying the experts. We pay attention to the dietary needs of many while only serving what we consider to be delicious. Options for meat dishes, vegetarian dishes, vegan dishes, or gluten free dishes are available.</p>
